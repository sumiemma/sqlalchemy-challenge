## Installation

Software Jupyter Notebook is being used to write the code, and to generate the results, and the environment is PythonDataUCB, provided by UC Berkeley.


## Description

This is the Module 10 challenge for the UC Berkeley Data Analyticd Boot Camp. In this challenge, we are using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. Then, a Flask API will be created based on the analysis.
